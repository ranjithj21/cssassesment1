    <h3><i>What is CSS?</i></h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li> <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li> <br>
        <li><del>Css is not necessary</del> <span><b>CSS saves a lot of work</b></span>. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li> <br>
        <li><i><u>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</u></i></li>
    </ol>
    <h3><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep styles in external CSS files. However,<span><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</b></span>, because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it yourself.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the diffrence is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URl to link directly to an element and its used by Javascript.
     <br><br> In CSS selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. once a element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. 
     <br><br> There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
